All options take one parameter, except for those marked as a flag option.
Options can also be set using a custom config file (see `--config` option), in
which case, flag options, if set, can be unset by prefixing `no-` to the name,
for example, `--no-ssl` to explicitly disable SSL.

This is a full list of options. Use `--help` to see a summarized version.

Upload Server Options:

  -h,  --host                Host/server to upload to. Prefix with `unix:` to
                             specify a Unix socket path.
                             SSL with Unix sockets requires NodeJS >= 0.12
  -P,  --port                Port to connect to (default 119 or 563 if `--ssl`
                             is specified)
  -6,  --ipv6                Connect over IPv6 (flag option)
                             Requires NodeJS >= 0.12
       --bind-host           Local address to bind to
       --tcp-keep-alive      If set, enables TCP keep-alive with the probe
                             interval set the number specified.
  -S,  --ssl                 Connect over SSL/TLS (flag option)
       --ignore-cert         Ignore SSL certificate problems (flag option)
       --sni-host            SNI host name to send if connecting over SSL
       --ssl-ciphers         List of SSL ciphers to use, in OpenSSL format
                             See https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html for defaults
                             Requires NodeJS >= 0.12
       --ssl-method          Force SSL/TLS method. For details, see
                             `secureProtocol` at https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html
       --ssl-ca              PEM encoded file containing trusted CA for
                             certificate validation. Can be specified multiple
                             times. Specifying this option disables the default
                             CA trust store.
  -u,  --user                Username to authenticate with
  -p,  --password            Password to authenticate with
  -n,  --connections         Number of connections to create for posting
                             (default 3)
       --max-upload-rate     Throttle rate at which posts are uploaded at. This
                             option is in the form {size}/{time}, for example
                             "10M/5s" which means 10 MiB per 5 seconds. If the
                             quantity is omitted, 1 is assume, e.g. "2M/s".
                             The size indicates the burst rate, so "2M/s" means
                             that 2 MiB must be sent before any throttling can
                             occur, whilst "10M/5s" allows a 10 MiB burst.
                             Set to 0 to disable.
       --timeout             Timeout on server responses (default 30s)
                             Set to 0 to disable (i.e. wait forever)
       --connect-timeout     Connect timeout (default 30s)  Set to 0 to disable
       --post-timeout        Timeout on sending post data (default 120s)
                             Set to 0 to disable
       --connect-retries     Number of connection retry attempts (default 1)
       --reconnect-delay     Delay connection retries (default 15s)
       --request-retries     Number of request retry attempts (default 5)
       --retry-on-bad-resp   Treat bad responses as a request failure instead
                             of a fatal error (flag option)
       --post-retries        Number of post retry attempts in response to 441
                             errors (default 1)
       --post-retry-delay    Delay post retries (default 0s)
       --post-fail-reconnect Treat posting failures as connection fatal errors.
                             This causes the connection to be reestablished in
                             response to this error (flag option)
                             If set, note that `--post-retries` and
                             `--post-retry-delay` options will be ignored.
       --error-teardown      Force teardown of bad connections (flag option).
                             If unset, bad connections are closed gracefully.
       --disconnect-timeout  How long to wait for a connection to disconnect
                             before forcefully tearing it down (default 5s).
                             Set to 0 to disable
       --keep-alive          Try to always keep connection alive even if not
                             needed (flag option).

Article/Post Options:

  -a,  --article-size        Target size of each news post (default 700K). Note
                             that yEnc makes the actual size larger.
       --article-line-size   Target bytes per line (default 128)
  -t,  --comment             Comment to insert before post subject
       --comment2            Comment to append after post subject
  -F,  --group-files         Group files by filename, similar to how indexers
                             would see them. This only affects the file counter
                             placed in the subject (flag option)
  -s,  --subject             Subject to use for posts. The following
                             placeholders are available:
                                 {filenum}   Current file number in collection
                                 {0filenum}  Current file number in collection,
                                             pre-padded with 0's
                                 {files}     Number of files in collection
                                 {filename}  File's name
                                 {fnamebase} File's name without extension;
                                             uses same logic as `--group-files`
                                 {filesize}  File's size in bytes
                                 {fileksize} File's size in KiB, rounded to 2dp
                                             Replace the 'k' with 'm', 'g', 't'
                                             for sizes in MiB, GiB and TiB
                                             respectively, e.g. {filemsize}
                                 {fileasize} Friendly formatted file size, e.g.
                                             '4.85 MiB' or '35.1 GiB'
                                 {part}      Article part number
                                 {0part}     Article part number, pre-padded
                                             with 0's to be as long as {parts}
                                 {parts}     Number of articles for the file
                                 {size}      Article chunk size (before yEnc)
                                 {comment}   Value from `--comment`
                                 {comment2}  Value from `--comment2`
                                 {timestamp} Unix timestamp of post
                                 ${rand(N)}  Random text, N characters long
                             Default is similar to the following:
                                 {comment} [{0filenum}/{files}] - "{filename}" yEnc ({part}/{parts}) {filesize} {comment2}
                             Note that {timestamp} and ${rand(N)} are different
                             for every post. They are not intended to be used
                             with `--subject`, but for `--message-id` instead.
                             Also note that this differs from the subject
                             option present in PowerPost based clients, as this
                             option specifies the entire subject. Nyuu does not
                             enforce any format and will not attempt to fix a
                             badly formed subject.
       --filename            How on disk file names are transformed into a
                             'filename' for use in posting. The following
                             placeholders are available:
                                 {filename} Full file name and path as
                                            specified in command supplied
                                 {basename} Base file name without path
                                 {pathname} Path component of file name
                             Default is `{basename}` which effectively
                             discards path names.
                             Note that this option has no effect on files not
                             sourced from disk.
  -f,  --from                Shortcut for `-H From=...`
                             Defaults to 'username <username@host>', where
                             these values are sourced from the local system.
                             See `--subject` for available placeholders.
  -g,  --groups              Shortcut for `-H Newsgroups=...`
                             Separate multiple groups with commas, without any
                             spaces.
                             Defaults to alt.binaries.test
       --date                Override the Date header, Message-ID timestamp,
                             and timestamps for generated NZBs, with specified
                             date. This can be useful if you wish to expose
                             less timing information (or obfuscate your
                             timezone). Can use the special value 'now' to
                             refer Nyuu's start time. If unset (default), will
                             use the time at which each post is encoded. This
                             differs from 'now' in that it is not a fixed
                             timestamp across the whole run.
       --message-id          Format of generated Message-ID. See `--subject`
                             for available placeholders.
                             Default is similar to: ${rand(24)}-{timestamp}@nyuu
       --keep-message-id     Don't randomize Message-ID every time the post is
                             submitted. (flag option)
  -H,  --header              Specify an NNTP header in either of these forms:
                                 -H "MyHeader: MyValue"
                                 -H MyHeader=MyValue
                             This option can be specified multiple times. Note
                             that specifying the same header more than once is
                             currently not supported.
       --article-encoding    Character encoding used in article/yEnc headers.
                             Also affects NNTP commands. Accepted values are
                             `ascii`, `latin1` and `utf8` (default `utf8`)

Post Check Options:

  You can prefix any of the options from the above "Upload Server Options"
  section, with `--check-` to override that behaviour on these checking
  connections. For example, `--check-host` overrides the `--host` parameter,
  making Nyuu perform post checking on a different host. `--check-post-retries`
  is unavailable as no posting is performed on these connections.

  -k,  --check-connections   Number of connections to create for post checking
                             (default 0). Set to 1 to enable checking. Higher
                             numbers of connections are only useful if post
                             checking is bottlenecking the rest of the process.
                             Note that the total number of connections spawned
                             equals this number + `--connections`
       --check-tries         Maximum number of check attempts to perform.
                             A value of 0 disables post checking. (default 2)
       --check-delay         Initial delay after posting before performing
                             first check (default 5s)
       --check-retry-delay   Delay for check retries, if a check fails
                             (default 30s). Not used if `--check-tries` < 2
       --check-post-tries    Maximum number of attempts to re-post articles
                             that the post check could not find. Set to 0 to
                             disable re-posting articles (default 1)
       --check-queue-size    Max number of articles queued for checking.
                             Posting will stall if the number of articles to be
                             checked exceeds this number. Default 10000.

Other Upload/Check Options:

  -e,  --skip-errors         Continue processing regardless of specified
                             errors. By default, Nyuu stops on all errors. You
                             can specify `--skip-errors all` to skip all
                             skippable errors, otherwise a comma separated list
                             of the following should be specified:
                                 post-timeout: post request timed out; if set,
                                               assumes post was successful
                                 post-reject: server rejects sent post; if set,
                                              assume post was successful
                                 post-fail: posting failed for any reason; if
                                            set, post is skipped
                                 check-timeout: check request timed out; if set
                                                assume check was successful
                                 check-missing: post checking fails to find the
                                                posted article; assume success
                                 check-fail: check failed for any reason; if
                                             set, assume success
                                 connect-fail: connect/login failed for any
                                               reason; if set, ignore failed
                                               connections
                             Note that for requests that are retried (posting),
                             only the last result is considered.
                             Also note: Nyuu will exit with return code 32
                             instead of 0 if the process completes and errors
                             were skipped.
       --post-error-limit    If specified, and errors are being skipped with
                             `--skip-errors`, will limit the number of post
                             errors that are tolerated before aborting the post
                             process.
       --use-lazy-connect    Only create connections when necessary and prefer
                             using as few as possible (flag option).
       --on-post-timeout     A list of actions to take in response to a post
                             request timing out. Available actions are:
                                 retry: re-send the post (default
                                        `--request-retries` times)
                                 strip-hdr=X: remove the header "X" and retry
                                 ignore: assume post is successful and continue
                                         - no further actions will be tried.
                                         Note that `--skip-errors post-timeout`
                                         will have no effect if this is set
                             List is comma separated; after all actions have
                             been tried, the post will fail. If this option is
                             supplied, `--request-retries` will not be used for
                             posts. Example usages:
                               --on-post-timeout retry,retry,ignore
                                   Retry the post up to two times on timeout,
                                   then just assume success
                               --on-post-timeout retry,strip-hdr=User-Agent,retry
                                   1st timeout: retry post
                                   2nd timeout: remove the User-Agent header,
                                   then retry
                                   3rd timeout: retry post (header still
                                   removed)
                                   4th timeout: give up and throw error
                             Note: removed headers stay removed, even when the
                             post is re-posted due to a check failure.
       --post-method         Command used for posting articles. Supported
                             commands listed below. Default is POST
                                 POST
                                 IHAVE
                                 XREPLIC
                                 TAKETHIS
                             Warning: XREPLIC only uses first specified group
                             and randomly generated article number
       --use-ihave           Alias for `--post-method IHAVE` (flag option)
                             Option is deprecated
       --check-group         Checking connections will be set to this group.
                             Some servers seem to want one set, otherwise
                             checking fails. If you set one, use a valid group
                             that you're not posting to, such as "bit.test"

NZB Output Options:

  -o,  --out                 If supplied, will write NZB to this file
                             Can be '-' which writes the NZB to stdout
                             You can also pipe this into the stdin of another
                             process by prefixing a command with `proc://`, for
                             example: `-o 'proc://cat>out.nzb'`, which is the
                             same as using `-o- | cat>out.nzb`. The stdout and
                             stderr of the process is discarded.
                             The following tokens are also supported (see
                             `--subject` for details):
                                 {filenum}
                                 {0filenum}
                                 {files}
                                 {filename}
                                 {fnamebase}
                                 {filesize}
                                 {fileksize} also {filemsize} etc
                                 {fileasize}
                                 {part} (always is 1)
                                 {0part}
                                 {parts}
                             If tokens are used, multiple NZB files may be
                             created (or multiple processes spawned if proc://
                             is used)
                             Nyuu can also pipe to a specified fd if prefixed
                             with fd:// (requires NodeJS >= 0.12), i.e.
                             `fd://1` being a shortcut for stdout.
  -O,  --overwrite           If NZB exists, overwrite it, otherwise will error
                             (flag option)
       --minify              Minify outputted NZB (flag option)
       --nzb-compress        Compress outputted NZB. Can be gzip, zlib, deflate
                             or brotli. (brotli requires NodeJS >= 11.7.0)
       --nzb-compress-level  Compression level (0-9) to use. Default is 6
                             For Brotli, range is 0-11, default being 11
       --nzb-title           A human-readable identifiable title for the
                             contents of the NZB
                             Shortcut for `-M title=...`
       --nzb-tag             An attribute of the NZB contents, such as "SD"
                             Can be specified multiple times
                             Shortcut for `-M tag=...`
       --nzb-category        Suggested category as used by your indexing
                             service (preferrably one, but can be specified
                             multiple times)
                             Shortcut for `-M category=...`
       --nzb-password        Attach a password to this NZB if its contents
                             requires one. Can be specified multiple times
                             if there are multiple passwords
                             Shortcut for `-M password=...`
  -M,  --meta                Add a <meta> tag to the NZB. See `--header` option
                             above for syntax details.
       --nzb-encoding        Character encoding used in the NZB (default utf-8)
                             See the following for a list of valid encodings:
                             https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffers_and_character_encodings
       --nzb-subject         Override the subject specified in the NZB. By
                             default, Nyuu uses the Subject header sent for the
                             first article of each file. If you want the
                             subject specified in the NZB to differ from that
                             uploaded, use this option.
                             This option supports the same tokens as `--out`.
                             In addition, {value} can be used to obtain the
                             value from the header.
                             Default is {value}
       --nzb-poster          Override the poster specified in the NZB, which,
                             is taken from the From header by default. Details
                             are the same as `--nzb-subject` described above.
                             Default is {value}

Advanced Tuning Options:

       --disk-req-size       Disk read request size (default
                             roundup(1M, `--article-size`))
       --disk-buf-size       Number of requests to read-ahead (default 1). Set
                             to 0 to disable read-ahead buffering.
       --nzb-cork            Cork (buffer) all NZB output (flag option).
                             Requires NodeJS >= 0.12
       --post-queue-size     Max number of buffered articles for posting
                             (default min(round(`--connections`*0.5)+2,25))
       --check-queue-cache   Max number of articles to cache in the check queue
                             (default 5, or if un-seekable streams are present,
                             min(`--connections`*8, 100)). Cache is not used if
                             `--check-post-tries` is 0. Caching prevents
                             articles from being re-read off disk if reposting
                             is necessary. Note that if un-seekable streams are
                             present, this option will limit the max number of
                             articles that can be queued for checking, as these
                             posts cannot be dropped from cache.
       --post-chunk-size     Limit upload chunk size to specified amount. Set
                             to 0 to disable (default 192K if
                             `--max-upload-rate` not specified)
       --use-post-pool       Use a buffer pool to improve memory management.
                             Buffers are pre-allocated, which can also improve
                             performance, but can increase memory usage.
                             If not enabled, will rely on V8's GC to clean up
                             buffers. Default is enabled, and is a flag option.
                             Use `--no-use-post-pool` to disable the buffer
                             pool.
       --connection-threads  Number of threads to distribute connections over.
                             If set, posting connections will be allocated
                             evenly across the specified number of threads. A
                             value of 0 disables migrating connections to
                             threads, using default NodeJS behaviour of
                             handling connections on the main thread.
                             Running connections in separate threads is mostly
                             useful if TLS/SSL is enabled but connection speed
                             is being limited by how fast one CPU core can
                             encrypt data.
                             This option requires NodeJS >= 11.7 or NodeJS >=
                             10.5 with `--experimental-worker` flag set.
                             `--max-upload-rate` is not supported with
                             connection threading.
                             Default 0
       --preload-modules     Preload modules into Node's module cache before
                             starting (flag option). This is mostly a
                             workaround to Node's shortcomming of not being
                             able to load modules asynchronously. Usually is
                             slower, but may be useful if the CPU or disk is
                             overloaded.

Post Dumping Options:

       --dump-failed-posts   Write out articles that fail to post to this
                             location. Message-ID will be appended to this to
                             get the file name. This is a debugging feature
                             and should not be used unless needed.
       --input-raw-posts     Treat input files as raw posts to be uploaded
                             (flag option). All options for Articles/Posts, NZB
                             output and Input will be ignored, as well as
                             `--disk-*` options. `--keep-message-id` option is
                             also implied (use `--no-keep-message-id` to
                             disable).
                             This is the counterpart to `--dump-failed-posts`
                             as it can be used to re-post these failed posts.
       --delete-raw-posts    Delete successfully posted raw articles (flag
                             option). This only has any effect if the
                             `--input-raw-posts` flag is specified.

UI Options:

  -l,  --log-level           Controls the output verbosity, value can be:
                                 0: completely silent (if command parsed)
                                 1: only show errors
                                 2: show warnings
                                 3: show information (default)
                                 4: show debugging info
  -v,  --verbose             Alias for `-l4` (flag option)
  -q,  --quiet               Alias for `-l2` (flag option)
       --colorize            Enable colors in terminal output (flag option)
                             Enabled by default if stderr is connected to a TTY
  -T,  --log-time            Add timestamps to log entries (flag option)
       --progress            Progress/status display control.
                             Value can be one of the below; if parameters are
                             needed, they are appended onto the end, separated
                             by a colon
                                 stderr: output a progress indicator to stderr
                                 stderrx: as above, but alternative format with
                                          more information
                                 stdout: same as stderr but output to stdout
                                 stdoutx: same as stderrx but output to stdout
                                 log: output log entries every 60s showing
                                      progress. Interval can be changed via the
                                      parameter
                                 tcp: start a TCP server which will spit out
                                      status information on connect, then close
                                      the connection
                                 http: start a HTTP server which returns status
                                       information
                             For both tcp and http options, you can specify a
                             host:port combo, or unix:/path/to/socket. If
                             unspecified, will default to listening on all
                             interfaces, on a random port.
                             This flag can be specified multiple times.
                             Default is `--progress stderr` if verbosity >= 3;
                             specify `--progress none` to suppress this.
                             Examples:
                               --progress log:30s
                                   Logs progress every 30 seconds
                               --progress http:[2001::1]:1234
                                   Start HTTP server on 2001::1 port 1234
                               --progress tcp:localhost
                                   Start TCP server on localhost on random port
  -C,  --config              Use a custom configuration file, see
                             config-sample.json for an example. The options
                             correspond with the command arguments documented
                             in this help file (full options only, short
                             aliases aren't supported).
                             Nyuu also accepts a complex config file, see

Input Files:

  Additional arguments are taken as files to be posted. Directories can be
  specified as well, in which case all files inside are processed according
  to the following options:

  -r,  --subdirs             How directories should be handled, can be:
                                 skip: ignore nested files
                                 include: include files in specified
                                          directories without recursion
                                          (default)
                                 keep: upload all files in sub-directories
                                       (with recursion)
  -L,  --skip-symlinks       If specified, all symbolic links will be ignored.
                             Note that this affects file symlinks as well as
                             directory traversal (if `--subdirs=keep` is
                             specified). By default, all symlinks are followed.
                             This option takes no values.

  Alternatively, a list of files can be supplied, with the following options:

  -i,  --input-file          Supply a text file which lists files, separated by
                             newlines, to be included as input. Can be `-` to
                             read from stdin, or a command prefixed with
                             proc:// to read from the stdout of specified
                             process (example: `proc://cat somefile.txt`). Can
                             also be an fd prefixed with fd:// (requires NodeJS
                             >= 0.12), i.e. `fd://0` is an alias for stdin.
                             Can be specified multiple times.
  -0,  --input-file0         Same as the `--input-file` option, except files
                             are separated by null characters instead of
                             newlines.
       --input-file-enc      Encoding used on all specified input files. Must
                             be a NodeJS recognised encoding, which includes
                             `utf8`, `utf16le` and `latin1`. Default is `utf8`.
                             Note that BOMs will not be interpreted.

  Nyuu also supports piping inputs from a command, however, as yEnc requires
  knowing exact file sizes in advance, this will need to be specified. The
  syntax for specifying a process input is as follows:
  
    procjson://"[name]",[size_in_bytes],"[command]"
  
  After the prefix, this is actually a 3 element JSON encoded array, where the
  square brackets are optional.
  [name] refers to the filename that will be used, it is your responsibility
  to ensure that there are no duplicates. [size_in_bytes] is the exact size of
  the data to be emitted from [command], in bytes. [command] is the command
  that will be executed, and its stdout will be uploaded. The stderr of this
  process is discarded, and nothing will be sent to stdin. If a number is
  supplied to [command] instead of a string, data will be read from the
  specified file descriptor rather than executing a process (requires NodeJS
  >= 0.12).
  Note that quotation marks and some other special characters may need to be
  escaped with backslashes, as per JSON encoding rules.
  
  For example, here's an elaborate way to upload the 6KB image, trollface.jpg
  as moe_kyun.jpg (note that `cat` is assumed to be the utility to read a file
  to stdout):
    nyuu -h 0 'procjson://"moe_kyun.jpg",6144,"cat trollface.jpg"' 

  Nyuu also supports copying input files to a file or process. The purpose of
  this feature is to send the data to somewhere else without incurring the cost
  of an additional disk read. This feature is currently EXPERIMENTAL.
  The following options are available for copying input:
  
  -I,  --copy-input          Copy each input into specified file or stdin of
                             specified process. See `--out` for syntax.
                             Special placeholders which can be used:
                                 {filename}: upload name of the file (no path)
                                 {size}: size of file in bytes
                             For example, the following can be used to
                             generate a list of MD5 hashes of the input files,
                             on Linux, without re-reading files off disk:
                               `--I "proc://echo `md5sum|sed s/-//` {filename} >>md5list`
                             WARNING: {filename} isn't sanitized in any way, so
                             take care when using it, especially when using it
                             in a command!
       --copy-include        Regular expression filter of which files to copy.
                             Only file names which match this filter will be
                             copied. Default ".*" (include all files).
       --copy-exclude        Regular expression exclusion filter over files to
                             copy. File names matching this expression won't
                             be copied. Default ".^" (no excluded files).
       --copy-queue-size     Maximum unconsumed buffer size for copied inputs.
                             If this buffer fills up, processing will slow down
                             until the other process consumes its piped data.
                             This value applies individually  to each input
                             copied. Set to 0 for no limit. (default 4)
                             Note that this is somewhat connected to
                             `--post-queue-size`

Exit codes:

  The end result can be determined from scripts by checking the exit code of
  the run. The following exit codes are used by Nyuu:

     0: no error occurred
     1: invalid command/usage; for NodeJS >= 0.11, also used for crashes
     8: for NodeJS version 0.10, process crashed
    32: process completed, but with errors
    33: process terminated due to an error

------------------
Examples

  nyuu -h example.com some_file
      Uploads some_file to the NNTP server at example.com

  nyuu -h news.example.com -S -u cat -p nyahaha -n3 -f 'Cat <eager-poster@computer>' -g alt.binaries.multimedia -o my_cat.nzb my_cat.mp4
      Uploads my_cat.mp4 to NNTPS server at news.example.com in group
      alt.binaries.multimedia. Upload is performed using 3 connections. 
      The from username is specified, and Nyuu will output an NZB, my_cat.nzb.
