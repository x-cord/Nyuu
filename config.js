/**** Nyuu options/config file ****/
// This file contains all the default options for Nyuu
// You can customize these options to avoid having to specify them on the command line, however it is recommended that you not edit this file
// It is strongly recommended that you create a config file and supply it to Nyuu via the `--config` option, see config-sample.json for an example
// If the .json config file isn't sufficient, you can copy this file elsewhere and still use the `--config` option to read it. Missing options there will sourced from this file
// WARNING: this file is not maintained for backwards compatibility; this means that you'll need to re-set all custom options every time Nyuu is upgraded!

skipSymlinks: false, // ignore all symlinks
// filenames will be transformed according to the following setting, which is a function that will have the file's path and name passed to it
